# Music Player Application

## Project Phase 0: Proposal

I will be creating a **music player application**. 

The application will allow users to:
- play and pause songs
- skip songs forward and back
- shuffle songs in a playlist
- browse curated playlists 
- create their playlists

The application is **designed for music lovers and music
listeners**. Since users can curate playlists for any 
occasion, mood, or activity, such as for their 
commute, workout, studies, and sleep, it is a practical 
tool that can be used throughout one's day.
I am eager to work on this project since I find myself
constantly listening to music and have noticed features
that I'd love to see in my preferred music player. 
This project will be a great start to understanding 
the backbone of a music player. With the coding skills 
I gain over this course, I hope to design more 
sophisticated features for my music player later on.
